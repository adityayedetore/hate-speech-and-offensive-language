You can find the writeup for this project [here](https://github.com/adityayedetore/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/blob/master/Classifying_Offensive_Language_on_Twitter_With_RNNs.ipynb)

## How to run our code

Requirements
* python 3.7.0
* pytorch 1.7.0
* torchtext 0.8.0
* A `cuda` enabled device

To train the models, run `python3.7 main.py`. 

To generate the plots, and view some other statistics there is a ipython notebook `analysis.ipynb`, which requires R to run.
